The `maxArea` function in the `Solution` class finds the maximum amount of water a container can hold between two vertical lines on a graph. 
It uses a two-pointer approach: one pointer starts at the beginning of the array and the other at the end. 
The function calculates the area of water that can be trapped between these two lines and updates the maximum area found. 
The pointer corresponding to the shorter line is moved inward to potentially find a taller line that might increase the area. 
This process continues until the pointers meet, ensuring an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).
